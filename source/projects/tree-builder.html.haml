    %h2 Title: PUI Tree-Builder Web Interface - Design and Implementation
    
  %p
    %strong Overview:
    The PUI Tree-Builder Web Interface project aimed to design an intuitive and efficient interface for building and managing tree structures within a web environment. The goal was to facilitate user actions such as creating, updating, and managing nodes, routines, loops, and junctions within a tree structure.

  %h2 Process:

  %ol
    %li
      %strong Research and Analysis:
      %ul
        %li Conducted user research to understand the needs and workflows of users who manage complex tree structures.
        %li Analyzed existing tools and interfaces to identify strengths and weaknesses.
    %li
      %strong Design Goals:
      %ul
        %li Create a user-friendly interface that simplifies the process of building and managing tree structures.
        %li Ensure the interface is visually intuitive and easy to navigate.
        %li Provide clear visual feedback for different states and actions, such as creating, updating, and deleting nodes.
    %li
      %strong Wireframes and Mockups:
      %ul
        %li Developed low-fidelity wireframes to map out the basic layout and functionality of the interface.
        %li Created high-fidelity mockups to illustrate the final design, including color schemes, typography, and interactive elements.
        %li Ensured that all design elements adhered to accessibility standards, including color contrast and readability.

  %h2 Outcome:
  %p The final design provided a seamless and efficient user experience for managing tree structures. Users could easily create, update, and navigate through nodes, routines, loops, and junctions. The interface's intuitive design minimized the learning curve and enhanced productivity.

  %h2 Visuals:

  %h3 Node Management:
  %ul
    %li
      %strong Node Creation:
      Users can create new nodes with a simple form, specifying details such as node type, labels, and connections.
    %li
      %strong Node States:
      Visual indicators for different node states, including default, selected, error, and matching nodes.

  %h3 Routine and Loop Management:
  %ul
    %li
      %strong Routine Creation:
      Users can define routines, specifying steps and conditions for each routine.
    %li
      %strong Loop Structures:
      Visual representation of loop heads and tails, indicating the start and end of loops within the tree structure.

  %h3 Junctions and Connectors:
  %ul
    %li
      %strong Junctions:
      Clear visual representation of junctions where multiple nodes or routines converge.
    %li
      %strong Connectors:
      Various types of connectors to illustrate the relationships and flow between nodes, routines, and loops.
