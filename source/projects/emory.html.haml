		%p Emory University, a top-tier research institution, sought to replace its costly proprietary library catalog system with an open-source alternative that improved accessibility and streamlined access for students, faculty, and external researchers. The goal was to design an intuitive, user-friendly interface that integrated seamlessly with the university's existing library systems while maintaining a high standard of usability and accessibility.
		%p
			As the
			%strong Lead Product Designer,
			I was responsible for ensuring a seamless 
			%strong user experience (UX) 
			and designing a UI that aligned with Emory University's existing digital ecosystem.
