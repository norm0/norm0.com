  %h2 About me
  %p I am a digital product designer, living near Minneapolis, Minnesota. I’ve spent the last 15 years at agencies, startups and software companies. 

  %p Building a website from cradle to grave has been my sweet spot as a designer and developer. 

  %p You can check out some of my past projects on Dribbble. Connect socially on Twitter. Read my full resume on LinkedIn. Or if you like, you can send me an email. Geek out on github.
